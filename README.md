# MyAlgoApp
App to learn Algorithms
 Interactive application to let users come intimately familiar with different alogrithms
 
 Who should use this application: Those who want ot brush up on the mechanics of certain algorithms, computer science students who are looking to learn how the algorithm works, or prospective employees looking to brush up on their algorithm skills before an interview.
 
 Why should they use this application: Remembering algorithms is hard. So having a pocket-sized dictionary explaining the algorithms and how they work could be helpful.
 
 How should they use the application:
 
 The user should be able to interact with elements of the demo and make choices as to the next correct iteration of teh algorithm.
 
 Will create the app using Activities and Fragments.
 
 Should also allow for user to search for specific algorithms in the application.
 
 Users should have a chance to either test their knowledge of an algorithm or read up on it and participate in a demonstration of the algorithm.
 
 The demos should consist of animations and clickable objects. As the user scrolls down the page, the animation should go along with it and play out what the algorithm does.
 
 This should come after come light text about the algorithm, and how it works. The user should have the option before the text to immediately test their skills or to go through the animation and they can try afterwards.
 
 Each algorithm should include a code example (whether sudocode or language-specific) and common uses for the algorithm.
